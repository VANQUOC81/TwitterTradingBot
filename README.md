# Algorithmic Trading Strategy using Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This is an algorithmic trading strategy built on the QuantConnect platform using Twitter data to analyze messages and trade based on sentiment.

## Data Collection

The Twitter data used in this project was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). However, for live trading, the Twitter API would be used to collect real-time data.

## Sentiment Analysis

The sentiment analysis model used in this project is based on a machine learning algorithm trained on a pre-labeled dataset of tweets. The model uses natural language processing techniques to classify tweets into positive, negative or neutral sentiment.

## Trading Strategy

The trading strategy is based on the sentiment score generated by the sentiment analysis model. If the sentiment score is positive, a long position is taken on the asset being traded. If the sentiment score is negative, a short position is taken on the asset. If the sentiment score is neutral, no position is taken.

## Technologies Used

* QuantConnect platform for backtesting and live trading
* Python programming language for data collection and sentiment analysis
* Kaggle for accessing tweet data
* Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library for sentiment analysis

## Backtesting

The trading strategy was backtested using historical data on the QuantConnect platform. The results of the backtest showed a profitable trading strategy.

## Live Trading

For live trading, the Twitter API would be used to collect real-time data. The sentiment analysis model would then be used to generate sentiment scores for the collected tweets. These scores would be used to execute trades based on the trading strategy outlined above.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the potential of using sentiment analysis to inform trading decisions. By incorporating real-time Twitter data, it is possible to develop a profitable trading strategy that takes advantage of market sentiment.
